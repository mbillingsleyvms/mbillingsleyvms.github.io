		<h2>The Princess Bride</h2>

		<img src="princessbride.jpg">
		<p>One of the many things I liked about this movie was that Cary Elwes and Mandy Patinkin learned to fence both left- and right-handed for the film, spending all their free time during the production practicing with fencing instructor Bob Anderson and with each other. (However, the actual swordfight scene between them was filmed using two separate, mirror-imaged, sets, giving the illusion that they were equally skilled with either hand.) Awesomely, they actually performed all of the fencing in the swordfight scene, although stunt doubles were used for the two somersaults. The amount of time spent practicing his fencing came in handy for Elwes, who later starred -- and used his fencing skills -- in the film <em>Glory</em> and in the Mel Brooks movie <em>Robin Hood: Men In Tights</em>,  in which he even went so far as to call out, 'Parry, parry, thrust, thrust -- good!'</p>

		<h2>Pirates (Roman Polanski)</h2>
		<img src="rp-pirates.jpg">
		<p>Although the title evokes a swashbuckling adventure, Roman Polanski's Pirates tuns out to be a seagoing tale with a bit of a difference. The film begins with Captain Red (Walter Matthau) stranded aboard a raft at sea with his first mate, Frog (Cris Campion), both of whom are presumably close to death from dehydration. After Red, cracking under the starvation, tries to kill and eat Frog, the duo is picked up by a Spanish Galleon and are forced into slavery before instigating a shipwide mutiny with the other prisoners and taking control of the vessel. Frog falls in love with the female love interest, Maria-Dolores de la Jenya de la Calde (Charlotte Lewis), the niece of the governor of a Spanish colony. Red covets the golden throne that the Spanish have taken from an Aztec king. Lots of explosions and gunfights occur as they recruit a crew of cutthroats to win over the gold (with Frog trying to romance the girl as well) throughout the remainder of the film. Ironically, the film ends in a Pyrrhic victory for the heroes, with Captain Red and Frog again stranded on a raft, Red sitting on the golden throne urging Frog to eat and "fatten up" (hinting at a possible relapse in his cannibalistic urges).

        <h2>Star Wars</h2>
        <img src="starWars.jpg">
        <p>The lightsaber sword fights in Star Wars were at first influenced by Japanese sword skills. The lightsaber duel in A New Hope looks a lot like Japanese Kendo and is pretty realistic, probably an homage to Kurosawa's samurai movies. Lightsabers differ from real swords, however, in that when steel swords clash, their blades slide along each other. That's why swords have cross guards to protect the hands. When lightsabers clash, they seem to lock together at a fixed point of the blade; this is probably why they don't have cross guards. The fights in A New Hope look like Japanese sword fighting: the movements are small and abrupt, fighters spend more time probing and watching each other tan swinging their swords around. In The Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi, the sword fights are more European. They were directed by Bob Anderson, an Olympic fencer specializing in the European sabre. He also choreographed fights in The Lord of the Rings, Highlander, Princess Bride, and The Mark of Zorro. In the Star Wars movies, he actually wore the Vader costume and did some of the fighting himself. The sword movements were a little exagerated, but always had a martial purpose. In the prequels, choreographed by Nick Gillard, the sword fighting is more high energy. The prequels came out at the same time as movies like The Matrix, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and Blade, and were probably influenced by the kung-fu-type fighting in those movies. Lots of spins and twirls and moves that look flashy but don't really have a martial purpose. Let's see what the sword fighting in the sequals looks like!
